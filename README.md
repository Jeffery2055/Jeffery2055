## Hi there I'm Jeremiah Gault

I am a Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a passion for programming hardware and robotics. I am currently learning to program with in-line assembly on an ATMega328P, and how to program embedded systems on a RPI PICO W. Some of my favorite projects I've worked on are a turn based text game, and a text based dungeon exploration game. As well as an GUI in Matlab to view and analyze ECG signals.
